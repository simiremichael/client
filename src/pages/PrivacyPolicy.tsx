            We take your privacy very seriously and are committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors and subscribers to our website <a href='www.propertyfinder.com'>www.propertyfinder.com</a> (the “Website”) or any application we make available via an app store (the <strong>“Application”</strong>, together with the Website, the <strong>“Platform”</strong>), and the corresponding services available through the Platform (the <strong>“Services”</strong>).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Below we set out our privacy policy, which will govern the way in which we process any personal information that you provide to us. We will notify you if the way in which we process your information is to change at any time.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Please read this privacy policy carefully as it contains important information on who we are and how we collect, store, use and share your information. By accessing the Platform or using our Services or otherwise indicating your consent, you agree to, and where required, consent to the collection, use and transfer of your information as set out in this policy. If you do not accept the terms of this policy, you must not use the Platform and/or the Services. This privacy policy supplements other notices and privacy policies and is not intended to override them.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This privacy policy: (i) applies only to the Platform and not to websites or applications of any other companies or organisations; and (ii) specifically addresses our obligations pursuant to the law of the Nigeria.
            <PrivacyTitle>The data we collect about you</PrivacyTitle>
            When you visit the Website or the Application or create a login in and password to access the Services, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. This may include: (i) your name and contact details, including email address and telephone number; (ii) information to enable us to check and verify your identity; (iii) location data; (iv) your billing information, transaction and payment information and history; and (v) such other information as we may from time to time require to provide the Services and comply with applicable law. You agree and, where required, consent to the collection of information about your usage of the Platform and the Services and information from messages and communications you send to us.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This information is required to provide the Services to you. If you do not provide such information, it may delay or prevent us from providing the Services.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This privacy policy will also apply when accessing the Platform and/or the Services from mobile technology (such as mobile phones, tablets or other devices). Unless you have chosen to remain anonymous through your device and/or platform settings, this information may be collected and used by us automatically if you use the Services and access the Platform from mobile technology.

            Calls between you and Property Finder, or between you and third parties made through Property Finder (such as real estate agents you contact about a property through a form or link on our Website, or using contact information found on our Website), may be recorded or monitored for quality assurance and customer service purposes. Property Finder uses a third-party service provider to track phone calls and text messages between you and real estate professionals so that we and the real estate professional can access certain details about the contact. As part of this process, Property Finder and its service provider will receive in real time and store data about your call or text message, including the date and time of the call or text message, your phone number, and the content of the text message.

            <br/>
            <PrivacyTitle>Who we share your personal information with</PrivacyTitle>
            Your personal information (which includes your name, address and any other details you provide to us which concern you as an individual) may be processed both by us and by other companies within our group. Each of the companies in our group authorised to process your information will do so in accordance with this privacy policy.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We may also share your information with: (i) third parties we use to help deliver our products and services to you (for example, payment service providers); (ii) other third parties we use to help us run our business (for example, marketing agencies or website hosts); and (iii) third parties approved by you (for example, social media sites you choose to link your account to or third-party payment providers).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We may use or share the information you provide to us if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce any obligation against you or to protect the rights of us and our affiliates. This may include the exchange of information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and prevention.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We may also need to share some personal information with our affiliates, subsidiaries and third parties (such as real estate agents that use the Website) or during a re-structuring of our business. Usually, personal information will be anonymised but this may not always be possible. The recipient of such personal information will be bound by confidentiality obligations.
